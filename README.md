# RERA-WEBSITE-REAL-ESTATE-
   The main objective of this web portal is to have an interface between builders and buyers with the registration of projects and escrow accounts. All the details of the builders and layout plan,status of sanctions and permissions from various departments and finally the timeline to finish the project  can be processed. This can be implemented in many ways using different tools. We have chosen laravel to develop the portal using interactive user interface. Usually the stakeholders (buyers/builders) are provided with login idâ€™s. The  department of     (L &amp; B) RERA ACT maintains separate URL for query management. Some parts of the portal are made public.   When a stakeholder submits a query it will be forwarded to the immediate authority of that department, a query will be logged into the database. Once the query is submitted, the timer for that query starts. Once the time taken for the response exceeds the timer limit the query gets triggered to the head of the department and necessary actions are taken. Using the logs maintained the Department of(L &amp; B) RERA act finds associative patterns on the received queries. So that we can identify the problems and resolved in an optimized manner.    This portal reduces unnecessary drift among the buyers. It makes easy for the authorities to resolve and provide solutions to these queries. It provides User friendly interface. It proves to be Robust.
